# Louvre landing page

This project was created as a task from the Rolling Scopes School.
Fully RWA, with both adaptive and responsive layout.
A few lines of JavaScript were used to add some interactivity.
Custom video-player with keyboard control support.

This application was my first web application ever.
It took me exactly 3 weeks of everyday coding.

A huge and ugly .css file with a bunch of useless and complex CSS rules was created due to a strict pixel-perfect task and lack of experience.
I have a plan to refactor this app, especially the CSS part of it.

Or maybe I'll keep it as a memory for myself in the future.
After all, everybody started somewhere and made their mistakes ðŸ˜„
